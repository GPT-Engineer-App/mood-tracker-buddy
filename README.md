# mood-tracker-buddy

Build me an mood tracker that allows me to save moods. A mood should have the following things connected: 
- Description
- Activity (select dropdown from activities)
- One emoji (select one from dropdown)
- Date created - DateTime (this should be automatic and not selected by user)

I should be able to create, update and delete moods
